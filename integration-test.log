Scenario: Add a measurement with valid (numeric) values from new instruments
  When I submit a new measurement as follows:
      | timestamp                  | pressure |
      | "2015-09-01T17:00:00.000Z" | 88.80    |
        Then the response has a status code of 201
  And the Location header has the path "/measurements/2015-09-01T17:00:00.000Z"

Scenario: Get stats for metric with same from and to date should be inclusive of from-date and exclusive of to-date
  Given I have submitted new measurements as follows:
      | timestamp                  | temperature | dewPoint |
      | "2015-09-01T16:00:00.000Z" | 27.1        | 16.9     |
      | "2015-09-01T16:10:00.000Z" | 27.3        |          |
      | "2015-09-01T16:20:00.000Z" | 27.5        | 17.1     |
      | "2015-09-01T16:30:00.000Z" | 27.4        | 17.3     |
      | "2015-09-01T16:40:00.000Z" | 27.2        |          |
      | "2015-09-01T17:00:00.000Z" | 28.1        | 18.3     |
        When I get stats with parameters:
      | param        | value                    |
      | stat         | min                      |
      | stat         | max                      |
      | stat         | average                  |
      | metric       | temperature              |
      | fromDateTime | 2015-09-01T16:00:00.000Z |
      | toDateTime   | 2015-09-01T16:01:00.000Z |
        Then the response has a status code of 200
  And the response body is an array of:
      | metric        | stat      | value |
      | "temperature" | "min"     | 27.1  |
      | "temperature" | "max"     | 27.1  |
      | "temperature" | "average" | 27.1  |
